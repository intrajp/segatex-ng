   segatex-ng daemon name segatexd - console program for SELinux 

   In 2006, segatex was born to help SELinux system administration.  
   It is written with C++ and Qt3 originally.  Although segatex is maintained untill 2017, 
   it became harder to catch up the new Qt version.  
   In 2017, the author, Shintaro Fujiwara, decided to write console program of segatex, 
   and started search for good base program.  "segatex-ng" means "segatex next generation".  
   He found "nss-pam-ldapd" written by Arthur de Jong of West Consuling is a excellent program, 
   so decided to borrow codes from it.  
   Although segatex-ng is not concerned about LDAP, its code style is the ones of the original program.  

   segatex-ng is a program for sysadmins using SELinux in everyday work.  
   segatexd is segatex-ng's daemon name.
