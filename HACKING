CONTRIBUTING TO SEGATEX-NG 
=============================

will be done on a best-effort basis and can be made easier if the following
are considered:

All contributions will be acknowledged in the AUTHORS file.

BUILD DEPENDENCIES
==================

For building Git snapshots the following tools are needed:

* autoconf
* automake
* libselinux

The segatexd uses autoconf and automake for building.
This is how I do the building right now.

$ aclocal
$ auconf
$ automake --add-missing
$ ./configure
$ make 

Shipping the contents of .tar.gz as done by this command.
$ make dist

RELEASE VERSIONING
==================

The versioning scheme of segatex-ng is a simple major.minor.micro
numbering. The idea is to keep a stable (x.y) branch that only gets bug fixes
and small enhancements while development goes in another branch. Backwards
incompatible changes should be announced clearly.

GENERAL DESIGN
==============
To know SELinux well in general.
If possible, help people to organize SELinux system.
